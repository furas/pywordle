# PyWordle

Wordle in Python using different GUIs/modules.

At this moment only with tkinter but still not ready.

Later I will try to do the same with PyQt, wxPython, Kivy, and maybe as web version with Flask, Bottle or Django.


### List of words (EN, PL) on Linux Mint/Ubuntu

In `README` in folder `dict` you can see how to create list of words using `aspell` and `bash` commands.


### Colors

I took colors from [Warble](https://avojak.com/blog/2022/01/19/the-story-of-warble/) for Linux `elementary OS`

```
COLOR_GREY   = '#ABABAB'
COLOR_GREEN  = '#9BDB4D'
COLOR_YELLOW = '#FFE16B'
```

<div style="background-color: #ABABAB">#ABABAB</div>
<div style="background-color: #9BDB4D">#9BDB4D</div>
<div style="background-color: #FFE16B">#FFE16B</div>

# PyWordle

Wordle in Python using different GUIs/modules.

At this moment only with tkinter but still not ready.

Later I will try to do the same with PyQt, wxPython, Kivy, and maybe as web version with Flask, Bottle or Django.


## List of words (EN, PL) on Linux Mint/Ubuntu

In `README` in folder `dict` you can see how to create list of words using `aspell` and `bash` commands.
